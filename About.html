 The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription found at the <br>
 Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā, a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara<br>
 Empire, established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas,<br>
 or pétés, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence<br>
 in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was came under Shahaji<br>
 Bhonsle as a jagir which later became his capital. The Mughals later captured Bangalore and sold it to Maharaja <br>
 Devaraja Wodeyar II of the Kingdom of Mysore.When Haider Ali seized control of the kingdom, the administration<br>
 of Bangalore passed into his hands.In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a twin city, with the "pētē",<br>
 whose residents were predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_people" target="_blank">Kannadigas</a> and the cantonment created by the British.Throughout the 19th century,<br>
 the Cantonment gradually expanded and acquired a distinct cultural and political salience as it was governed directly<br>
 by the British and was known as the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore. While it remained in the princely territory<br>
 of Mysore, Cantonment had a large military presence and a cosmopolitan civilian population that came from outside the <br>
 princely state of Mysore, including British and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian_people">Anglo-Indians</a> army officers. 
 After India's independence in August 1947, Bangalore remained in the newly carved Mysore State of which the Maharaja of
 Mysore was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org › wiki › Rajpramukh">Rajapramukh</a> (appointed governor).<br>
 The "City Improvement Trust" was formed in 1945,and in 1949,the "City" and the "Cantonment" merged to form the Bangalore<br>
 City Corporation.The Government of Karnataka later constituted the Bangalore Development Authority in 1976 to coordinate<br>
 the activities of these two bodies.Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the <br>
 rest of the state to migrate to the city.</div>
